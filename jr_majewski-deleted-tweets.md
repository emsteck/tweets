Most of you that are upset haven’t taken the time yourself to read my tweets. Had you done that, you would realize the challenges that I have had with PayPal and other pay apps.

Particularly someone like me who has selflessly supported  @realDonaldTrump    Please don't attack these people.. tell them the truth. Ironically the women they tagged are all traveling with their spouses.

If you believe that I am up to nefarious things.... realize that everything I have done, has been, and is, transparent to the donors involved. Most donors are not able to attend so they are paying it forward.

But factually speaking there is no cure for cancer. We can stop it from spreading but once cells become abnormal, we can’t return them to their natural state.. that would be the cure. Instead we treat to eradicate the cells.

Trump hasn’t outed VP & Chris Miller publicly endorsed him. If we know one thing, it’s that Chris doesn’t play games. He would not have said what he did if it wasn’t intended.

These behaviors are a direct cause to why my good friend, & West Point Grad  @WestPointWeber  was never publicly endorsed by The President...  it’s because he never kissed the staffers rings. He didn’t pay his dues.

The dirty game played in Washington was likely so beyond his moral compass that he didn’t realize & missed things being done to, & against him. People got close to him, with the sole intention of stabbing him in the back
